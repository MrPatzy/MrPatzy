# MrPatzy - Future Penetration Tester

Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile.

# About
-----

Welcome, my name is Zachary "Patzy" Patz and I am an aspiring penetration tester. I've been a professional cook for the last 12 years and I have been a chef for two of those years. I love to travel and I lived abroad in Italy while working in restaurants. I studied Italian on my own and became conversational, in doing so I found a love for languages. I have studied Spanish, German, Italian, and Arabic is my newest language. I'm entering the cyber security realm with both feet and I know exactly where I want to end up. I am excited to share my journey with you.

# Repositiories

## Cyber Tools

This is a well documented mixture of different projects that I have been working on to practice python. This will be updated with small projects that I work on, but I will possibly never finish. 

## Cloud Creation

A project from my Cyber Security Bootcamp. It displays my ability in Docker, ELK, and Azure. This project also shows network design. This project was fun, and I look forward to creating a similar version by myself.

# What Do I Bring to the Table?
-----

If you're looking here because you saw my resume, please let me reitterate my strong suits. I am aware I don't know everything but I know where to look and I know who to ask. My time in the food service industry has humbled me. I know that there is no real shortcut to hard work and dedication. I excell at working in teams, in high pressure situations, and with strict deadlines. My mom was an Art history professor and my father a DBA. This paired with my experience in restaurants, I excell in code switching and communiating both technical and non technical information quickly and efficently.
